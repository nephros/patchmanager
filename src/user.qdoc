  \title Patchmanager for SailfishOS

  Patchmanager is a tool for transparently modifying installed files by the
  patch utility and for managing the special patch files ("Patches") for doing
  so.

  Since version 3.0, Patchmanager does not modify original files on mass
  storage, it merely alters their content when they are loaded into RAM to be
  executed.

  \section1 Launching

  Patchmanager does not install an application icon on the launcher, but
  creates a new entry in SailfishOS' Settings app.

  \section1 Installing

  To install a recent Patchmanager the SailfishOS:Chum community repository can
  be used, which is easily accessed with the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application,
  which in turn can be installed via the
  \l{https://openrepos.net/content/olf/sailfishoschum-gui-installer}{SailfishOS:Chum GUI Installer}

  Alternatively Patchmanager can be installed from
  \l{https://openrepos.net/user/16848/programs}{its OpenRepos repository}
  using Storeman, which can be installed via the
   \l{https://openrepos.net/content/olf/storeman-installer}{Storeman Installer}.

  While these two sources can also be used to manually download and install
  Patchmanager, you may alternatively obtain Patchmanager RPMs from
  \l{https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/releases}{its releases page at GitHub}.

  \note The Patchmanager's OpenRepos repository and GitHub releases page also
  offer the final releases of Patchmanager 3.0 for SailfishOS < 3.4.0 and
  Patchmanager 2.3.3 for SailfishOS < 2.2.x.

  \section1 Getting Patches

  Modern Patches for Patchmanager 3 are provided via
  \l{https://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/projects/}{the Web Catalog}
  while older Patches were provided as
  \l{https://openrepos.net/category/patches}{RPMs at OpenRepos}
  and some of them are still maintained.

  Mind that many Patches were first released at OpenRepos but later migrated to
  the Web Catalog: For these you will find outdated RPMs, hence always search
  in the Web Catalog first.
